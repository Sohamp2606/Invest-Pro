## Introduction
<p>
  This webapplication is build to analyse the stocks, It featch real time stock price from API and show <b>PIE chart, LIVE chart,PREDICTION chart</b>, we can use algorithm to identify patterns through machine learning. One of the most well-known algorithm  is <b>LSTM (long short-term memory)</b> which is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is able to remember information over a long period of time, thus making them extremely useful for predicting stock prices. RNNs are well-suited to time series data and they are able to process the data step-by-step.
  The main objective of this project is to develop a web application that can predict stock price based on real-time data.
